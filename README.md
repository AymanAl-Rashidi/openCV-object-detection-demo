# OpenCV Object Detection Demo

This repository contains a collection of OpenCV experiments used to learn and demonstrate core computer vision concepts.  
The notebook includes multiple exercises such as:

## 📌 Features
- Reading and displaying images  
- Color conversions (BGR → RGB, HSV)  
- Creating color masks  
- Image resizing and cropping  
- Blurring techniques (Gaussian, Median, Average)  
- Edge detection using Canny  
- Image sharpening  
- Thresholding (simple, Otsu, adaptive)  
- Contour detection and bounding boxes  
- Drawing and annotation  
- Face detection using Haar Cascades  
- Simple CNN inference demo (ResNet-18)

## 📝 Notebook
The main notebook:  
`opencv_object_detection_demo.ipynb`

It walks through each step with examples and visual outputs.

## 🚀 How to Use
